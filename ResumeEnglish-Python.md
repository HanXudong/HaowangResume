- Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.
  - **Worked as a Developer** from April 2018 to November 2021
  - Designed and implemented a short video labeling system based on titles and vision for Tencent-Search engine.
  - Built Http's APIs as the interface with my colleagues's AI models and served these to clients.
  - Designed and implemented certificate's Optical Character Recognition system.
- Charworkshop Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.
  - **Work as a Developer** from November 2021 to now
  - Built RESTful APIs based on **Flask** that served data to the JavaScript front-end Pages.
  - Constructed a crawler system which is based on **Scrapy** to collect pet releted data.

- **Pet Community Website**
  - **Background**
    Built the back-end HTTPs interfaces which served data from database to front-end webpages. 
  - **Pet Article RestFul API**
    Built the Pet article HTTPs services and the user payments HTTPs services based on Flask. Used MySQL as the data stores. Used Redis as the key-value database. 
  - **Crawle System**
    Using Scrapy, I built out a crawle system for downloading pet related articles from several websites. And the system checks new articles from these websites everyday.
- **Video Labeling System**
  - **Background**
    Designed and implemented the system of Labeling short videos for Tencent-Search engine and these labels be applied in several results pages.
  - **Extracted labels from title**
    Trained sequence labeling models based on **Prompt tuning + Bert** to generate videos' labels and achieved a 83.24% AVG-F1 Score. Then deployed it as a Http Service. 
  - **Implemented the Program**
    Built the video data process system in spark platform and the videos' labels be finally written into the key-value database for downstream applications. This system processed ten thousand levels of video data every hour. The video labels increased the click rate by 15.3% (from 21.84% to 25.19%) in the video results page. The video labels supoorted the phrase-filtering and video-collecting functions.
- **AI Services**
  - **Background** 
    Built several identity documents OCR http api for Fusion Bank. And built HTTPs APIs that served AI capacity to the clients.
  - **OCR Implement**
    Built a pipeline to recognize different documents' texts. Trained models to tell types, find text regions and recognize words intelligently and integrated these models into the pipeline.
  - **AI HTTPs Services**
    Built HTTPs services of several AI models (traind in Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch) in finance and insurance fields. Based on Python Flask to develop the HTTPs api and used Gunicorn to serve interfaces in multiprocessing way.
