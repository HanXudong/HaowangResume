- **AI Services**
  - **Background**  
    Built several identity documents OCR HTTP API for Hong Kong Fusion Bank. And built HTTPs APIs that served applications of AI to clients.
  - **OCR Implement**  
    Built a pipeline to recognize different documents' texts. Trained models to tell types, find text regions and recognize words intelligently and integrated these models into the pipeline.
  - **AI HTTPs Services**  
    Built HTTPs services of several AI models (traind in Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch) in finance and insurance fields. Based on Spring Boot to develop HTTPs APIs and use good frameworks to support datasource connecting and persistence, logging and so on.
- **Fact-Checking Tool**
  - **Background**
    Developed a fact-checking app based on a fast-running checker service to check the factuality of a document.  
  - **Fact-Checking Pipeline**
    Built the pipeling of checking including document decomposer, decontextualizer, claim-worth checker, evidence retrieval and claim verifier. Optimized the whole pipeline with RabbitMQ and leveraged distributed infrastructure for efficient scaling. For real time text checking, Used VLLMs and GPU acceleration and achieved 150 QPS for real-time text checking.

- **Pet Community Website**
  - **Background**  
    Designed and implemented the backend system for pet community website to share and get information of pets. 
  - **Pet Article RestFul APIs**  
    Firstly developed RESTful API for user data interaction service. In addition, developed role-based access control module for articles management. Both are based on Spring Boot. Used Mysql as the data stores. Used Redis as the key-value database. 
  - **Article Crawle System**  
    By using Scrapy, I built out a crawle system for downloading pet related articles from several websites. And the system checks new articles from these websites everyday.
- **Video Labeling System**
  - **Background**  
    Designed and implemented the system of Labeling short videos for Tencent-Search engine and these labels be applied in several results pages.
  - **Extracted labels from title**  
    Trained sequence labeling models based on **Prompt tuning + Bert** to generate videos' labels and achieved a 83.24% AVG-F1 Score. Then deployed it as a Http Service. 
  - **Implemented the Program**  
    Built the video data process system in Tencent **spark** data platform and the videos' labels be finally written into the key-value databases for downstream applications. This system processed ten thousand levels of video data every hour. The video labels increased the click rate by 15.3% (from 21.84% to 25.19%) in the video results page. The video labels supoorted the phrase-filtering and video-collecting functions.
